Description: A solution to our chosen problem domain - student cooking. The aim of the project was to solve the problem of students not knowing how to cook, which led to a plethora of issues, such as poorer health and more money spent on convenience foods.

UniChef is an android app that allows users to share their own recipes, which others can view and interact with.
